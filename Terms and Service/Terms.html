        <p>For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Minute Burger”, “our” or “we” shall refer to Leslie Corporation and its subsidiaries, while “customer” or “you” shall refer to the customer who intends to purchase the Products from this Site.</p>
        <p>All materials/content found in our Online Services may not be copied, distributed, republished, uploaded, posted, or transmitted in any way, without our prior written consent EXCEPT you may download one copy materials and content on one computer for your personal, non-commercial, home use only.

    <h2>Account Creation</h2>
    <p>If you decide to place an order through this Site, you will be asked to register by creating an account which requires your personal information such as name, complete delivery address, telephone or mobile number, email address and a password. Creating an account allows you to automatically fill-up all the necessary delivery details in your next order. Inputting and confirming a password on the “Create an Account” or “Guest Information” page of the website, along with other information, allows you to make an account. You must keep this password confidential and must not disclose it to anyone. If you believe someone else knows your password, please change your password immediately.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend your registration if you violate any of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
    <p>When you choose to create an account by linking it with an external third party service or application, such as Facebook, this feature will not modify nor allow the access of the content of your Facebook account. However, if you use your Facebook account to create an account in this Site, the following shall apply:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your Facebook account name shall be your Account name in the website;</li>
            <li>The e-mail address of your Facebook account shall be used as the e-mail address for your Account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If another person used your account to order Products on your behalf, with or without your knowledge, such order shall be subject to these Terms and Conditions, and you agree that the order shall be considered your own and will be charged to you.</p>
        <h2>Finding Stores Nearest Your Location</h2>
        <p>If you decide to use our Nearest Me feature, you will be asked by your browser to allow MB Go to use your current location to find stores. This information will only be used to find stores nearest your current location and will not be stored. If you would like to find stores nearest you on another time or date, you must select “Nearest Me” again. If your active location is currently moving such as in a moving vehicle or if you are walking, the Nearest Me feature may not be as accurate.</p>
        <p>The location feature is an approximate guide and uses your device’s GPS capabilities and connection to provide an approximate location. You must still refer to the address and map (provided at the checkout page) to confirm that the store you selected is indeed nearest your current location.</p>
        <h2>Submission of Order</h2>
        <p>Upon submission of your online order, you are authorizing us to process your online order and preparation of the Products you have specified on your order form. However, we reserve the right to refuse the processing of your order without any notification should we find any incorrect or incomplete details, or any previous spurious transactions with the given personal information.</p>
        <p>Also, non-response to SMS and calls from the store may result in late or non-delivery of the Products and should not be taken against us. Additional verification call or confirmation call may be required to proceed with your order.</p>
        <h2>Regular Order</h2>
        <p>By submitting your order through this Site, you understand and agree that the processing of your order is subject to the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There is a twenty (20) to thirty (30) minute preparation time for single receipt transactions amounting to P600 and below. The exact time of pickup shall be indicated at the order confirmation page which the customer will agree to once the order is placed. However, this preparation guarantee does not apply if there are more than 10 orders per transaction of the same product combinations. If we are unable to have your products prepared for pickup by the time that the order is due, you will be allowed to cancel your order due to waiting too long. You understand and accept, however, that any delay due to heavy traffic, inclement weather, unavoidable technical difficulties in the stores, or similar or conditions or circumstances, are beyond our control and should not at any time be taken against us. Pickup services may also not be available in cases of extreme weather, natural disasters, and unavoidable technical difficulties in the store/s in your area.</li>
            <li>For Orders amounting to P600.00 and up you will receive a call from our store to verify your identity and your order details. Due to the volume of the Products ordered, we do not guarantee that orders can be prepared within the standard preparation time and the store will coordinate with you on the serving time.</li>
            <li>Orders above P1500, are considered bulk orders and will not be accepted by the Site. Instead,the Site will prompt you to contact the store directly to place your order.</li>
            <li>Excessive requests of items such as packaging, paper napkins, and the like are subject to store discretion.</li>
            <li>Any other special request outside the list of the Minute Burger product menu is strictly prohibited. Additional special request such as medicine, newspaper, cigarettes, grocery items and the likes will not be entertained.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Advance Order</h2>
        <p>If you wish to order in advance through this website, you may place your order within the calendar day.</p>
        <p>The acceptance of orders for the Products made through the Site shall be at the entire discretion of Minute Burger. We reserve the right to decline to accept the order or deliver the Products without giving any reason.</p>
        <p>Our acceptance of an order occurs when the order status has been updated to show that the store is now preparing your order (“Order Confirmation”). The Order Confirmation is a record of our agreement to deliver the Products you ordered and your obligation to pay the price of the Products in full. The Order Summary serves as your Order Confirmation and will contain the following information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your pertinent order number;</li>
            <li>The date and time of your order;</li>

            <li>The Minute Burger store that has received and will process your order; and</li>
            <li>The contact number of the Minute Burger store that has received your order.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Changes of Order</h2>

        <p>Changes in your order can be made before a store accepts your order by cancelling it and re-ordering.</p>
        <p>After the store has accepted your order, you may agree on change with the store by calling the Minute Burger store that received the order or by contacting the store through the contact details indicated in the order summary page.</p>
        <p>If you wish to change your order prior to pickup time, please call (through the contact number provided in the Order Confirmation) the Minute Burger store within the timeframe stated above, and provide the details of your order included in the Order Confirmation.</p>
        <p>Changes in your order that are confirmed by the pertinent Minute Burger store will reset the thirty (30) minute preparation time, and will likewise be subject to these Terms and Conditions. You understand that the total amount of your order will be changed should there be any changes in your order, and that you agree to pay the new total amount upon delivery. Thus:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you paid for your order online via credit card, any additional price difference as a result of changing your order must be paid in cash, payable upon delivery.</li>
            <li>If, as a result of any change/s you make to your order, the total amount payable is less than the amount paid online via credit card, any amount paid in excess of the new total amount payable shall be refunded to you by your own bank. You understand and agree that in such a case, we will not process the refund on your behalf, and that you are personally responsible for processing the refund with your own issuing bank.,</li>
            <li>If you choose to pay by credit card upon delivery (card present), the total amount shall be chargeable and payable upon delivery.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If any of the changes to order include promotions which are only available for limited periods, any changes to your order may mean that the promotions are no longer available by the time the changes are made.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to refuse any modification in case the order has already begun preparation and cooking prior to receipt of your request.</p>
    <h2>Cancellation of Orders</h2>
    <p>Orders may be cancelled before a store accepts your order. After, cancellations are to be done by calling or messaging the Minute Burger store that received your order. Cancellation immediately after the time that the Order Confirmation was received will no longer be valid. You understand and agree that cancellation beyond this time will require you to pay the full amount of the order placed by you.</p>
